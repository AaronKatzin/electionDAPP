# electionDAPP

THE SOURCE CODE WAS WAY TOO LARGE TO UPLOAD TO MOODLE, SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE CODE FROM https://github.com/AaronKatzin/electionDAPP

In order to use this DAPP:

1. Clone this repo from https://github.com/AaronKatzin/electionDAPP.

2. CD to the project root.

3. Run "npm install" and "bower install" in order to install dependencies.

4. Install and open Ganache, then quickstart ethereum.

5. Install MetaMask, import the accounts from ganache based on the MNEMONIC/seeder phrase

6. Run run.cmd to compile/migrate contracts, start the web server, and open the voter page.

7. Import the compiled Election contract hash as a new token in MetaMask and it will show up as the VT token



To easily view a demo of the DAPP you can go to https://aaronkatzin.github.io/electionDAPP/.

The demo doesn't function due to no blockchain running (e.g. Ganache). But the GUIs will load.
