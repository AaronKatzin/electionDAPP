# electionDAPP

In order to use this DAPP:

1. Clone this repo.

2. CD to the project root.

3. Run "npm install" and "bower install" in order to install dependencies.

4. Install and open Ganache, then quickstart ethereum.

5. Run run.cmd to compile/migrate contracts, start the web server, and open the voter page.



To easily view a demo of the DAPP you can go to https://aaronkatzin.github.io/electionDAPP/.

The demo doesn't function due to no blockchain running (e.g. Ganache). But the GUIs will load.
